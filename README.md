# [My Repertory](my-repertory.vercel.app)

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"An app where you can create and manage music repertoires that you want to keep fresh in your memory"._

## Why?

This project came about after a problem that I as a musician had been facing for a long time: I always ended up forgetting how to play some songs after a while without practicing, so I needed something to show me when was the last time I played a certain song, so I could practice again and keep it fresh in my memory

This is an authorial project in constant development, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## Functionalities

- Sign-Up and Sign-In. I decided to make this functionality so that different users create their own lists, and only this user has access

- Create as many repertories as you want

- Add musics to a existing repertory

- Mark a music as practiced

- Delete a music from your repertory

- Musics
  - See when was the last time this was practiced
  - See the lyrics and tabs of this song
